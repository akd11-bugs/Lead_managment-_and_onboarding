// (same reasoning as lib/devBypass.ts).
//
// Single source of truth for "this path skips Neon Auth's middleware" —
// proxy.ts's isPublicPage check and app/login/page.tsx's post-login redirect
// validation must agree on this list. They used to be separate, which is
// exactly how a real bug shipped: a request to "/" carrying Neon Auth's
// OAuth verifier query param needs to pass THROUGH neonAuth.middleware() to
// complete the session exchange, but "/" was (correctly) also public for a
// logged-out visitor — so an unvalidated callbackURL/redirectTo pointing at
// any of these other public paths would hit the exact same silent failure:
// a session created server-side that the browser never actually receives a
// cookie for. A crafted `/login?from=/rep/acme` link, or any other code path
// that builds a callbackURL from user input, must never resolve to one of
// these — see isSafeRedirectTarget below.
